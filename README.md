# pytorch-ramblings

Various files for me to test and learn PyTorch. Currently, FC-LSTM is in-progress as I explore activation functions, and try to figure out how to properly handle gradients (not working properly according to temporal structure at the moment).

Getting mid-80s on IMDB, mid-60s on Yelp.

Todo:
[ ] Better commenting and explanation through ipynbs
[ ] Sync ipynbs and pys better, currently pys are more developed so that I can run them in a screen remotely
[ ] Add seq2seq for chatbot
[ ] Refine FCLSTM
[ ] Improve README and add dataset links
